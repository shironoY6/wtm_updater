Telegram bot translating WTM into Japanese and forwarding

This is a user bot (with PHONE) that translates English posts from a public channel (WTM, https://t.me/WeTheMedia) into Japanese and post them to WTMjp (https://t.me/WTM_deepl_jp).
These public channels are hard coded but with a small effort this can be converted to other use cases (different lang / channel).

## Installation

- Ubuntu or similar

- pip install requirements.txt

## Usage

- set environmental variables

see the if-name-main boilerplate of `Updater.py` for details.
